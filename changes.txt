# Major Issues/Changes Addressed in SQL Agent Chat Session

## 1. ASYNC TIMEOUT ISSUE (execute_db.py)
**Problem:** 
- SQL queries were timing out with CancelledError
- Agent would make tool calls but get null output
- BigQuery queries executed successfully but results never returned to agent
- Issue was in async wrapper using run_in_executor() causing thread executor timeouts

**Solution:** 
- Refactored execute_query() to be directly async instead of using sync + wrapper
- Removed arun() wrapper function that used run_in_executor()
- Made execute_query() handle BigQuery operations asynchronously with proper await calls
- Updated tool definition to use execute_query as both func and coroutine

**Files Changed:** agents/tools/execute_db.py

## 2. SQL AGENT PROMPT OPTIMIZATION (main2.py)
**Problem:**
- Overly verbose and confusing prompt
- Complex sample queries in schema docs were misleading the agent
- No clear error handling guidelines or retry limits
- Missing BigQuery-specific syntax guidance
- Unclear success/failure criteria leading to infinite retry loops

**Solution:**
- Simplified opening from verbose multi-paragraph to single clear sentence
- Changed from "Generate and execute BigQuery SQL" to more organic "Answer user questions using tools available"
- Added "BEFORE WRITING SQL" planning step to catch logic errors early
- Set clear retry limits (MAX 3 attempts)
- Added BigQuery-specific syntax notes and common gotchas
- Removed confusing sample queries from schema display
- Streamlined response format with clear success/error criteria

**Files Changed:** agents/sql/main2.py

## 3. AGENT CONTAMINATION ISSUE (Multi-agent behavior)
**Problem:**
- Search agent was mimicking SQL agent's response format
- Agents seeing shared conversation history and copying patterns from other agents
- Search agent saying "Results successfully gathered" when it only did searches
- Loss of distinct agent identities due to pattern reinforcement in shared context

**Solution Identified (Not Yet Implemented):**
- Add distinct response format constraints for each agent type
- Search agent: Must start with "Search complete:" or "Found:"
- SQL agent: Must start with "SQL Results obtained:"
- Visualiser: Must start with "Visualization created:"
- Add agent identity enforcement in supervisor prompt
- Create strong behavioral anchors that resist contamination

**Files to Change:** 
- agents/search/main.py
- agents/sql/main2.py  
- agents/visualiser/main2.py
- agents/sql_with_preprocess/supervisor.py

## Summary
These changes address: (1) Technical async execution issues, (2) Prompt engineering for better SQL generation, and (3) Multi-agent system behavioral consistency to prevent role confusion.
