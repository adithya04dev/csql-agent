If they haven\\'t faced any balls, the average is set to 0.\\\\n3.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n4.  **`WHERE hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\') AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the ground is either \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\' or \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\' and the competition is \\'IPL\\'.\\\\n5.  **`GROUP BY hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat`**: Groups the results by batter name and player ID so we get statistics for each player.\\\\n6.  **`HAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0`**: Filters out players who have not faced any balls at the venue, ensuring that batting average is meaningful.\\\\n7.  **`ORDER BY batting_average DESC`**: Orders the results in descending order of batting average, so the players with the best averages appear first.\\\\n\\\\nThis query provides a clear and accurate way to find the batting averages for all players at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in IPL matches.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Note:**\\\\n- The `bat_out = 0` condition is used because we need to calculate the number of times the batter was not out to calculate the average.\\\\n- The `CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL)` ensures that the division is performed with decimal precision to return a more accurate batting average.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'16906150-3481-499c-8b89-e4699355bcc0\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.bat,\\\\n    hdata.p_bat,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.ballfaced) AS total_balls,\\\\n    CASE\\\\n        WHEN SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0 THEN CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat_out = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) \\\\n        ELSE 0\\\\n    END AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\')\\\\n    AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat\\\\nHAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    batting_average DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'7c55cb80-95c7-413d-9a89-e1d4fafe8805\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'960194a5-6a29-4979-8404-4ed44c1ba1ed\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

It first checks if the batter has faced any balls (to avoid division by zero). If they have, it calculates the average by dividing the total runs by number of times they were not out. If they haven\\'t faced any balls, the average is set to 0.\\\\n3.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n4.  **`WHERE hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\') AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the ground is either \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\' or \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\' and the competition is \\'IPL\\'.\\\\n5.  **`GROUP BY hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat`**: Groups the results by batter name and player ID so we get statistics for each player.\\\\n6.  **`HAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0`**: Filters out players who have not faced any balls at the venue, ensuring that batting average is meaningful.\\\\n7.  **`ORDER BY batting_average DESC`**: Orders the results in descending order of batting average, so the players with the best averages appear first.\\\\n\\\\nThis query provides a clear and accurate way to find the batting averages for all players at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in IPL matches.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Note:**\\\\n- The `bat_out = 0` condition is used because we need to calculate the number of times the batter was not out to calculate the average.\\\\n- The `CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL)` ensures that the division is performed with decimal precision to return a more accurate batting average.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'16906150-3481-499c-8b89-e4699355bcc0\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.bat,\\\\n    hdata.p_bat,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.ballfaced) AS total_balls,\\\\n    CASE\\\\n        WHEN SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0 THEN CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat_out = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) \\\\n        ELSE 0\\\\n    END AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\')\\\\n    AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat\\\\nHAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    batting_average DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'7c55cb80-95c7-413d-9a89-e1d4fafe8805\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'960194a5-6a29-4979-8404-4ed44c1ba1ed\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='dd6259fd-c80a-4477-8cb0-4069f6f27088')],\n",

It first checks if the batter has faced any balls (to avoid division by zero). If they have, it calculates the average by dividing the total runs by number of times they were not out. If they haven\\'t faced any balls, the average is set to 0.\\\\n3.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n4.  **`WHERE hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\') AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the ground is either \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\' or \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\' and the competition is \\'IPL\\'.\\\\n5.  **`GROUP BY hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat`**: Groups the results by batter name and player ID so we get statistics for each player.\\\\n6.  **`HAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0`**: Filters out players who have not faced any balls at the venue, ensuring that batting average is meaningful.\\\\n7.  **`ORDER BY batting_average DESC`**: Orders the results in descending order of batting average, so the players with the best averages appear first.\\\\n\\\\nThis query provides a clear and accurate way to find the batting averages for all players at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in IPL matches.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Note:**\\\\n- The `bat_out = 0` condition is used because we need to calculate the number of times the batter was not out to calculate the average.\\\\n- The `CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL)` ensures that the division is performed with decimal precision to return a more accurate batting average.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'16906150-3481-499c-8b89-e4699355bcc0\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.bat,\\\\n    hdata.p_bat,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.ballfaced) AS total_balls,\\\\n    CASE\\\\n        WHEN SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0 THEN CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat_out = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) \\\\n        ELSE 0\\\\n    END AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\')\\\\n    AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat\\\\nHAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    batting_average DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'7c55cb80-95c7-413d-9a89-e1d4fafe8805\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'960194a5-6a29-4979-8404-4ed44c1ba1ed\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='dd6259fd-c80a-4477-8cb0-4069f6f27088')],\n",

It first checks if the batter has faced any balls (to avoid division by zero). If they have, it calculates the average by dividing the total runs by number of times they were not out. If they haven\\'t faced any balls, the average is set to 0.\\\\n3.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n4.  **`WHERE hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\') AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the ground is either \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\' or \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\' and the competition is \\'IPL\\'.\\\\n5.  **`GROUP BY hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat`**: Groups the results by batter name and player ID so we get statistics for each player.\\\\n6.  **`HAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0`**: Filters out players who have not faced any balls at the venue, ensuring that batting average is meaningful.\\\\n7.  **`ORDER BY batting_average DESC`**: Orders the results in descending order of batting average, so the players with the best averages appear first.\\\\n\\\\nThis query provides a clear and accurate way to find the batting averages for all players at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in IPL matches.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Note:**\\\\n- The `bat_out = 0` condition is used because we need to calculate the number of times the batter was not out to calculate the average.\\\\n- The `CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL)` ensures that the division is performed with decimal precision to return a more accurate batting average.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'16906150-3481-499c-8b89-e4699355bcc0\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.bat,\\\\n    hdata.p_bat,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(hdata.ballfaced) AS total_balls,\\\\n    CASE\\\\n        WHEN SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0 THEN CAST(SUM(hdata.batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat_out = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) \\\\n        ELSE 0\\\\n    END AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground IN (\\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bengaluru\\', \\'M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore\\')\\\\n    AND hdata.competition = \\'IPL\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.bat, hdata.p_bat\\\\nHAVING SUM(hdata.ballfaced) > 0\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    batting_average DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'7c55cb80-95c7-413d-9a89-e1d4fafe8805\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'960194a5-6a29-4979-8404-4ed44c1ba1ed\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='dd6259fd-c80a-4477-8cb0-4069f6f27088'),\n",

Based on the previous conversation, you want to generate SQL queries for match statistics at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground using the `hdata` table. Here\\'s how we can proceed, keeping in mind the requirement to not execute the query:\\\\n\\\\n**Understanding the Goal**\\\\n\\\\nThe goal is to retrieve match-level statistics, filtered for matches played at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground. We\\'ll need to use the `ground` column to identify these matches.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a SQL query that would achieve this, along with explanations:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`SELECT ... FROM hdata`**: This selects the columns needed from the `hdata` table.\\\\n2.  **`WHERE hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'`**: This filters the data to include only rows where the `ground` column is \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n3.  **`GROUP BY hdata.p_match, hdata.date, hdata.year, hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl`**: This groups the rows by match, so that we get aggregate statistics for each match.\\\\n4. **`ORDER BY hdata.date`**: This orders the results by the date of the match\\\\n5.  **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings`**: This counts the total number of innings played in each match.\\\\n6.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored`**: This calculates the total runs scored in each match.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken`**: This calculates the total wickets taken in each match.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Considerations:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Data Availability:** The effectiveness of this query depends on the data available in your `hdata` table. Make sure the `ground` column has consistent values like \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n*   **Aggregate Functions:** The query includes basic aggregate functions. You can add more to get more detailed match statistics (e.g., total runs by team, total wickets by bowler etc)\\\\n*   **Performance:** For very large tables, indexing the `ground` column would improve query performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nThis query will give you a starting point. You can modify it further to extract specific statistics that you\\'re interested in. For example, if you want to see top run scorers at Lord\\'s, you\\'d need a different query.\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you\\'d like to refine this query or explore other types of analysis.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'6a43b59b-d5be-4385-895b-0a7fc231632f\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'58cc7a1c-f5c9-4725-bf46-b43e1475540b\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'f50e7992-f092-45a1-a992-7e2f16bf695e\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

Based on the previous conversation, you want to generate SQL queries for match statistics at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground using the `hdata` table. Here\\'s how we can proceed, keeping in mind the requirement to not execute the query:\\\\n\\\\n**Understanding the Goal**\\\\n\\\\nThe goal is to retrieve match-level statistics, filtered for matches played at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground. We\\'ll need to use the `ground` column to identify these matches.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a SQL query that would achieve this, along with explanations:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`SELECT ... FROM hdata`**: This selects the columns needed from the `hdata` table.\\\\n2.  **`WHERE hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'`**: This filters the data to include only rows where the `ground` column is \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n3.  **`GROUP BY hdata.p_match, hdata.date, hdata.year, hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl`**: This groups the rows by match, so that we get aggregate statistics for each match.\\\\n4. **`ORDER BY hdata.date`**: This orders the results by the date of the match\\\\n5.  **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings`**: This counts the total number of innings played in each match.\\\\n6.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored`**: This calculates the total runs scored in each match.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken`**: This calculates the total wickets taken in each match.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Considerations:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Data Availability:** The effectiveness of this query depends on the data available in your `hdata` table. Make sure the `ground` column has consistent values like \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n*   **Aggregate Functions:** The query includes basic aggregate functions. You can add more to get more detailed match statistics (e.g., total runs by team, total wickets by bowler etc)\\\\n*   **Performance:** For very large tables, indexing the `ground` column would improve query performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nThis query will give you a starting point. You can modify it further to extract specific statistics that you\\'re interested in. For example, if you want to see top run scorers at Lord\\'s, you\\'d need a different query.\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you\\'d like to refine this query or explore other types of analysis.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'6a43b59b-d5be-4385-895b-0a7fc231632f\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'58cc7a1c-f5c9-4725-bf46-b43e1475540b\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'f50e7992-f092-45a1-a992-7e2f16bf695e\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='f55eb396-163f-438f-9dd2-a809721c8423')],\n",

Based on the previous conversation, you want to generate SQL queries for match statistics at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground using the `hdata` table. Here\\'s how we can proceed, keeping in mind the requirement to not execute the query:\\\\n\\\\n**Understanding the Goal**\\\\n\\\\nThe goal is to retrieve match-level statistics, filtered for matches played at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground. We\\'ll need to use the `ground` column to identify these matches.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a SQL query that would achieve this, along with explanations:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`SELECT ... FROM hdata`**: This selects the columns needed from the `hdata` table.\\\\n2.  **`WHERE hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'`**: This filters the data to include only rows where the `ground` column is \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n3.  **`GROUP BY hdata.p_match, hdata.date, hdata.year, hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl`**: This groups the rows by match, so that we get aggregate statistics for each match.\\\\n4. **`ORDER BY hdata.date`**: This orders the results by the date of the match\\\\n5.  **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings`**: This counts the total number of innings played in each match.\\\\n6.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored`**: This calculates the total runs scored in each match.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken`**: This calculates the total wickets taken in each match.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Considerations:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Data Availability:** The effectiveness of this query depends on the data available in your `hdata` table. Make sure the `ground` column has consistent values like \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n*   **Aggregate Functions:** The query includes basic aggregate functions. You can add more to get more detailed match statistics (e.g., total runs by team, total wickets by bowler etc)\\\\n*   **Performance:** For very large tables, indexing the `ground` column would improve query performance.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\nThis query will give you a starting point. You can modify it further to extract specific statistics that you\\'re interested in. For example, if you want to see top run scorers at Lord\\'s, you\\'d need a different query.\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you\\'d like to refine this query or explore other types of analysis.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'6a43b59b-d5be-4385-895b-0a7fc231632f\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'58cc7a1c-f5c9-4725-bf46-b43e1475540b\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'f50e7992-f092-45a1-a992-7e2f16bf695e\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='f55eb396-163f-438f-9dd2-a809721c8423')],\n",

      "              HumanMessage(content='SQL Agent Response: [AIMessage(content=\"SQL Agent Response : Okay, I understand. Based on the previous conversation, you want to generate SQL queries for match statistics at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground using the `hdata` table. Here\\'s how we can proceed, keeping in mind the requirement to not execute the query:\\\\n\\\\n**Understanding the Goal**\\\\n\\\\nThe goal is to retrieve match-level statistics, filtered for matches played at Lord\\'s Cricket Ground. We\\'ll need to use the `ground` column to identify these matches.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s a SQL query that would achieve this, along with explanations:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    hdata.p_match,  -- Match identifier\\\\n    hdata.date,  -- Date of the match\\\\n    hdata.year,  -- Year of the match\\\\n    hdata.winner, -- Winner of the match\\\\n    hdata.toss, -- Team that won the toss\\\\n    hdata.team_bat, -- Team that batted first\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl, -- Team that bowled first\\\\n    -- Add more match-level aggregates here as needed.\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings, -- Total innings in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored, -- Total runs scored in the match\\\\n    SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken -- Total wickets taken in the match\\\\n    -- You can add more aggregate functions like SUM(hdata.batruns), SUM(hdata.bowlruns) etc to get total runs, wickets etc.\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' -- Filter for matches at Lord\\'s\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    hdata.p_match, hdata.date,hdata.year,hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl -- Group by match to get match-level stats\\\\nORDER BY hdata.date;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`SELECT ... FROM hdata`**: This selects the columns needed from the `hdata` table.\\\\n2.  **`WHERE hdata.ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'`**: This filters the data to include only rows where the `ground` column is \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n3.  **`GROUP BY hdata.p_match, hdata.date, hdata.year, hdata.winner, hdata.toss, hdata.team_bat, hdata.team_bowl`**: This groups the rows by match, so that we get aggregate statistics for each match.\\\\n4. **`ORDER BY hdata.date`**: This orders the results by the date of the match\\\\n5.  **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.inns) AS total_innings`**: This counts the total number of innings played in each match.\\\\n6.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_runs) AS total_runs_scored`**: This calculates the total runs scored in each match.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(hdata.inns_wkts) AS total_wickets_taken`**: This calculates the total wickets taken in each match.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Considerations:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Data Availability:** The effectiveness of this query depends on the data available in your `hdata` table. Make sure the `ground` column has consistent values like \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\'.\\\\n*   **Aggregate Functions:** The query includes basic aggregate functions.

Finally, it sums these counts.\\\\n3.  **`COUNT(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' THEN 1 END) AS balls_faced`**:\\\\n    *   This calculates the total number of balls faced by David Warner against India.\\\\n    *   It counts 1 for each row where `hdata.bat` is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\', effectively counting the number of balls faced.\\\\n4.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' THEN hdata.score ELSE 0 END) AS total_runs`**:\\\\n    *   This calculates the total runs scored by David Warner against India.\\\\n    *   It adds up the `hdata.score` for each ball where `hdata.bat` is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\'.\\\\n5. **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.p_match) AS matches_played`**:\\\\n    *   This calculates the number of matches where David Warner has batted against India.\\\\n    *   It counts the distinct `p_match` values where `hdata.bat` is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\'.\\\\n6.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' AND hdata.score = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fours`**:\\\\n    *   This calculates the number of fours hit by David Warner against India.\\\\n    *   It counts 1 when the `hdata.bat` is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' and `hdata.score` is 4, otherwise it counts 0. Finally sums the counts.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' AND hdata.score = 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sixes`**:\\\\n    *   This calculates the number of sixes hit by David Warner against India.\\\\n    *    It counts 1 when the `hdata.bat` is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' and `hdata.score` is 6, otherwise it counts 0. Finally sums the counts.\\\\n8.  **`WHERE hdata.team_bowl = \\\\\\'India\\\\\\' AND hdata.bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\'`**:\\\\n    *   This filters the data to include only the records where the bowling team is \\\\\\'India\\\\\\' and the batter is \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\'.\\\\n\\\\nThis query should give you a comprehensive set of statistics for David Warner against Indian bowlers.\\\\n\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'d3b1d9a0-a629-49af-bc4b-83fb54c681a6\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.out = TRUE AND hdata.p_out = (SELECT DISTINCT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS times_out,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\'David Warner\\' THEN 1 END) AS balls_faced,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\'David Warner\\' THEN hdata.score ELSE 0 END) AS total_runs,\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.p_match) AS matches_played,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\'David Warner\\' AND hdata.score = 4 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fours,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.bat = \\'David Warner\\' AND hdata.score = 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sixes\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl = \\'India\\' AND hdata.bat = \\'David Warner\\';\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'f6a44538-19b9-47f6-820b-e99f4758b63f\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'3b107f0a-0263-482d-b42b-a9bc905c06ef\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",
