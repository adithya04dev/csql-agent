You want to generate SQL queries for cricket statistics at Lord\\\\\\'s Cricket Ground, which we\\\\\\'ve identified as \"Lord\\\\\\'s, London\" in the `ground` column of your `hdata` table. \\\\n\\\\nHere\\\\\\'s a breakdown of how to proceed and some example queries you might be interested in, along with explanations:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Basic Match Count at Lord\\\\\\'s:**\\\\n\\\\n   This query gets the total number of matches played at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS total_matches\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\';\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Runs Scored at Lord\\\\\\'s:**\\\\n\\\\n   This query calculates the total runs scored across all matches at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\';\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Total Wickets Taken at Lord\\\\\\'s:**\\\\n\\\\n   This query calculates the total wickets taken across all matches at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_wickets\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\' AND outcome = \\\\\\'wicket\\\\\\';\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Average Runs per Match at Lord\\\\\\'s:**\\\\n\\\\n   This query calculates the average runs scored per match at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT CAST(SUM(score) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS avg_runs_per_match\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\';\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Most Successful Batters at Lord\\\\\\'s (by runs):**\\\\n\\\\n   This query finds the batters with the most runs at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT bat, SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\'\\\\n   GROUP BY bat\\\\n   ORDER BY total_runs DESC\\\\n   LIMIT 10; -- Show the top 10\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Most Successful Bowlers at Lord\\\\\\'s (by wickets):**\\\\n\\\\n   This query finds the bowlers with the most wickets at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT bowl, COUNT(*) AS total_wickets\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\' AND outcome = \\\\\\'wicket\\\\\\'\\\\n   GROUP BY bowl\\\\n   ORDER BY total_wickets DESC\\\\n   LIMIT 10; -- Show the top 10\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**7. Match Results at Lord\\\\\\'s (Winners):**\\\\n\\\\n   This query gets the list of winners at Lord\\\\\\'s\\\\n\\\\n   ```sql\\\\n   SELECT DISTINCT winner\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\' and winner IS NOT NULL;\\\\n   ```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation of Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`SELECT` Clause:**  Specifies the columns you want to retrieve.\\\\n*   **`FROM hdata` Clause:** Specifies the table you\\\\\\'re querying (`hdata`).\\\\n*   **`WHERE ground = \\\\\\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\\\\\'` Clause:** Filters the results to include only records from matches at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT p_match)`:** Counts the number of unique matches.\\\\n*   **`SUM(score)`:** Calculates the sum of runs.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(*)`:** Counts the total number of records (e.g., wickets).\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY bat` / `GROUP BY bowl`:** Groups the results by player name for aggregate calculations.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY total_runs DESC` / `ORDER BY total_wickets DESC`:** Orders the results in descending order based on the total runs/wickets.\\\\n*  **`LIMIT 10`:** Limits the results to the top 10.\\\\n*   **`CAST(SUM(score) AS REAL)`:** Converts the sum of runs to a real number for accurate average calculation.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Choose a Query:** Select the query (or queries) that you want to run based on the specific analysis you want to perform.\\\\n2.  **Execute the Query:**  You can execute the query in your SQL environment (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) where your `hdata` table is located.\\\\n3.  **Analyze the Results:**  Interpret the output of the query to gain insights into the cricket statistics at Lord\\\\\\'s.\\\\n\\\\nLet me know if you have any more specific questions or need more complex queries!\\\\n\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'3468516a-feac-4aae-a3a2-d6e07230f908\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT DISTINCT winner\\\\n   FROM hdata\\\\n   WHERE ground = \\'Lord\\\\\\\\\\'s, London\\' and winner IS NOT NULL;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'fecb2d12-ea8e-4302-979a-af0209ed43a3\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'9547b3d4-3eea-4bfa-9b7a-b54524fb2c71\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

The line can be categorized based on where the ball pitches in relation to the batsman.\\n\\nThe three main categories of the line of delivery in cricket are:\\n\\n1. **On the Stumps**: The ball is directed straight at the stumps.

Here\\\\\\'s the SQL query to achieve that:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    year,\\\\n    SUM(batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_outs,\\\\n    COUNT(p_match) AS matches_played,\\\\n    SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced,\\\\n    CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat = \\\\\\'Travis Head\\\\\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    year\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    year;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **`SELECT year, ...`**: This selects the year for grouping and calculating yearly stats.\\\\n2.  **`SUM(batruns) AS total_runs`**: Calculates the total runs scored by Travis Head in each year.\\\\n3.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_outs`**: Counts the number of times Travis Head got out in each year.\\\\n4. **`COUNT(p_match) AS matches_played`**: Counts the total number of matches played by Travis Head in each year.\\\\n5.  **`SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced`**: Calculates the total balls faced by Travis Head in each year.\\\\n6.  **`CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS batting_average`**: Calculates the batting average for each year.  We cast the sum of `batruns` to `REAL` to ensure a decimal result for the average.\\\\n7.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n8.  **`WHERE bat = \\\\\\'Travis Head\\\\\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the batter is Travis Head.\\\\n9.  **`GROUP BY year`**: Groups the results by year, so we get aggregated statistics for each year.\\\\n10. **`ORDER BY year`**: Sorts the results by year in ascending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Notes:**\\\\n\\\\n*   This query assumes that the batter\\\\\\'s name is stored as \"Travis Head\" in the `bat` column consistently.\\\\n*   The query calculates batting average by dividing total runs by total outs. If a player doesn\\\\\\'t get out in a year, the average will be NULL. You might want to add a `NULLIF` check if you want to handle cases with no outs differently.\\\\n*   The query includes matches_played assuming that each unique `p_match` value corresponds to one match.\\\\n*   The batting average is calculated and shown as a real number.\\\\n\\\\nThis query should give you a good overview of Travis Head\\\\\\'s batting performance year by year.\\\\n\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'b5b8ef0c-f89c-40c4-8ac2-cbc58a66eb92\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    year,\\\\n    SUM(batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_outs,\\\\n    COUNT(p_match) AS matches_played,\\\\n    SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced,\\\\n    CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat = \\'Travis Head\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    year\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    year;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'54cba968-d939-4cbb-9b6a-ce56c94dda16\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'385af1ad-0510-4806-ac23-94b9d063f63d\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

We cast the sum of `batruns` to `REAL` to ensure a decimal result for the average.\\\\n7.  **`FROM hdata`**: Specifies that we are querying the `hdata` table.\\\\n8.  **`WHERE bat = \\\\\\'Travis Head\\\\\\'`**: Filters the data to include only records where the batter is Travis Head.\\\\n9.  **`GROUP BY year`**: Groups the results by year, so we get aggregated statistics for each year.\\\\n10. **`ORDER BY year`**: Sorts the results by year in ascending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important Notes:**\\\\n\\\\n*   This query assumes that the batter\\\\\\'s name is stored as \"Travis Head\" in the `bat` column consistently.\\\\n*   The query calculates batting average by dividing total runs by total outs. If a player doesn\\\\\\'t get out in a year, the average will be NULL. You might want to add a `NULLIF` check if you want to handle cases with no outs differently.\\\\n*   The query includes matches_played assuming that each unique `p_match` value corresponds to one match.\\\\n*   The batting average is calculated and shown as a real number.\\\\n\\\\nThis query should give you a good overview of Travis Head\\\\\\'s batting performance year by year.\\\\n\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'b5b8ef0c-f89c-40c4-8ac2-cbc58a66eb92\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    year,\\\\n    SUM(batruns) AS total_runs,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_outs,\\\\n    COUNT(p_match) AS matches_played,\\\\n    SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced,\\\\n    CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / SUM(CASE WHEN bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS batting_average\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat = \\'Travis Head\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    year\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    year;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'54cba968-d939-4cbb-9b6a-ce56c94dda16\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'385af1ad-0510-4806-ac23-94b9d063f63d\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='382b542c-1e8b-4f17-9fee-0c46437e58a8')],\n",

Since the `hdata` table doesn\\'t have a `year` column directly, we need to use the `date` column to extract the year. Also, I need to identify Shadab Khan using his player ID (`p_bat` and `p_bowl`). Since I don\\'t have a table with player names, I will assume that we know Shadab Khan\\'s player IDs. Let\\'s assume for now that Shadab Khan has a `p_bat` ID of 123 and a `p_bowl` ID of 456. **You need to replace these with the actual IDs of Shadab Khan.**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s the SQL query to analyze Shadab Khan\\'s performance in 2023, combining batting and bowling stats.

Since I don\\'t have a table with player names, I will assume that we know Shadab Khan\\'s player IDs.

Remember to replace 123 and 456 with the actual player IDs:\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    \\'Batting\\' AS PerformanceType,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN 1 END) AS MatchesPlayedBatting,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN batruns ELSE 0 END) AS TotalRuns,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN ballfaced ELSE 0 END) AS BallsFaced,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' AND bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS TimesOut,\\\\n    AVG(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bat_runs * 1.0 / cur_bat_bf END) AS AvgBattingScore,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalWickets,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalRunsConceded\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    CAST(strftime(\\'%Y\\', date) AS INTEGER) = 2023 and p_bat = 123\\\\n\\\\nUNION ALL\\\\n\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    \\'Bowling\\' AS PerformanceType,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN 1 END) AS MatchesPlayedBowling,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalRuns,\\\\n    NULL AS BallsFaced,\\\\n     NULL AS TimesOut,\\\\n     NULL as AvgBattingScore,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bowl_wkts ELSE 0 END) AS TotalWickets,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bowl_runs ELSE 0 END) AS TotalRunsConceded\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    CAST(strftime(\\'%Y\\', date) AS INTEGER) = 2023 and p_bowl = 456;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Batting Statistics:**\\\\n    *   It selects records where the batter (`bat`) is \\'Shadab Khan\\'.\\\\n    *   `MatchesPlayedBatting`: Counts the number of matches where Shadab Khan batted.\\\\n    *   `TotalRuns`: Sum of runs scored by Shadab Khan.\\\\n    *   `BallsFaced`: Sum of balls faced by Shadab Khan.\\\\n    *   `TimesOut`: Counts how many times Shadab Khan was out.\\\\n    *   `AvgBattingScore`: Calculates the average batting score.\\\\n2.  **Bowling Statistics:**\\\\n    *   It selects records where the bowler (`bowl`) is \\'Shadab Khan\\'.\\\\n    *   `MatchesPlayedBowling`: Counts matches where Shadab Khan bowled.\\\\n    *   `TotalWickets`: Sum of wickets taken by Shadab Khan.\\\\n    *    `TotalRunsConceded`: Sum of runs conceded by Shadab Khan.\\\\n3.  **`UNION ALL`**: Combines the results of the batting and bowling queries into a single result set.\\\\n4.  **Date Filtering:** `CAST(strftime(\\'%Y\\', date) AS INTEGER) = 2023` extracts the year from the `date` column and filters for the year 2023.\\\\n5.  **Player ID Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause filters for the specific player IDs (`p_bat` and `p_bowl`).\\\\n6. **NULL values**: NULL values are included for columns that are not applicable to the query.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Replace 123 and 456:**  You MUST replace `123` and `456` with the correct `p_bat` and `p_bowl` values for Shadab Khan.\\\\n*   **Player Name:** This query assumes you know the name \\'Shadab Khan\\'. If you only have the IDs, adjust the query to use only player IDs.\\\\n*   **Database Compatibility:** This query uses SQLite syntax (`strftime(\\'%Y\\', date)`). If you are using a different database system, you might need to adjust the date extraction function (e.g., `YEAR(date)` in MySQL).\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Get the Player IDs:** Find the correct `p_bat` and `p_bowl` values for Shadab Khan from your data.\\\\n2.  **Run the Query:** Replace the placeholder IDs and run the query against your database.\\\\n3.  **Analyze Results:** Examine the output to understand Shadab Khan\\'s performance in 2023.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'a658f964-8e31-4f86-9213-19abbb0dc4c9\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    \\'Batting\\' AS PerformanceType,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN 1 END) AS MatchesPlayedBatting,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN batruns ELSE 0 END) AS TotalRuns,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN ballfaced ELSE 0 END) AS BallsFaced,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' AND bat_out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS TimesOut,\\\\n    AVG(CASE WHEN bat = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bat_runs * 1.0 / cur_bat_bf END) AS AvgBattingScore,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalWickets,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalRunsConceded\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    CAST(strftime(\\'%Y\\', date) AS INTEGER) = 2023 and p_bat = 123\\\\n\\\\nUNION ALL\\\\n\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    \\'Bowling\\' AS PerformanceType,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN 1 END) AS MatchesPlayedBowling,\\\\n    NULL AS TotalRuns,\\\\n    NULL AS BallsFaced,\\\\n     NULL AS TimesOut,\\\\n     NULL as AvgBattingScore,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bowl_wkts ELSE 0 END) AS TotalWickets,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN bowl = \\'Shadab Khan\\' THEN cur_bowl_runs ELSE 0 END) AS TotalRunsConceded\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    CAST(strftime(\\'%Y\\', date) AS INTEGER) = 2023 and p_bowl = 456;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'e8648512-8c44-4817-a56f-f854d545556a\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'624e9a8d-b059-442e-99ef-cf3b9b98a1cc\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c34e15c9-d42e-4d44-93ec-1909a4a607b0'),\n",

Since the `hdata` table doesn\\'t have a `year` column directly, we need to use the `date` column to extract the year. Also, I need to identify Shadab Khan using his player ID (`p_bat` and `p_bowl`). Since I don\\'t have a table with player names, I will assume that we know Shadab Khan\\'s player IDs. Let\\'s assume for now that Shadab Khan has a `p_bat` ID of 123 and a `p_bowl` ID of 456. **You need to replace these with the actual IDs of Shadab Khan.**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s the SQL query to analyze Shadab Khan\\'s performance in 2023, combining batting and bowling stats.

Since the `hdata` table doesn\\'t have a `year` column directly, we need to use the `date` column to extract the year. Also, I need to identify Shadab Khan using his player ID (`p_bat` and `p_bowl`). Since I don\\'t have a table with player names, I will assume that we know Shadab Khan\\'s player IDs. Let\\'s assume for now that Shadab Khan has a `p_bat` ID of 123 and a `p_bowl` ID of 456. **You need to replace these with the actual IDs of Shadab Khan.**\\\\n\\\\nHere\\'s the SQL query to analyze Shadab Khan\\'s performance in 2023, combining batting and bowling stats.

Since I don\\'t have a table with player names, I will assume that we know Shadab Khan\\'s player IDs.

Since we don\\'t have a specific request yet, I\\'ll start with some basic queries that cover common performance metrics.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some SQL queries to get started, focusing on MS Dhoni\\'s batting and bowling stats (though he\\'s primarily a batsman):\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(batruns) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Times MS Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' AND bat_out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Total Number of Matches Played by MS Dhoni (Batting):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs Scored by MS Dhoni (Batting):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN bat_out = FALSE THEN p_match ELSE NULL END) AS batting_average\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Highest Score by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT MAX(batruns) AS highest_score\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7.  Number of Wickets Taken by MS Dhoni (Bowling):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN out = TRUE AND p_bowl = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' LIMIT 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_wickets\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bowl = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' LIMIT 1)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.

Since we don\\'t have a specific request yet, I\\'ll start with some basic queries that cover common performance metrics.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some SQL queries to get started, focusing on MS Dhoni\\'s batting and bowling stats (though he\\'s primarily a batsman):\\\\n\\\\n**1.

Since we don\\'t have a specific request yet, I\\'ll start with some basic queries that cover common performance metrics.\\\\n\\\\nHere are some SQL queries to get started, focusing on MS Dhoni\\'s batting and bowling stats (though he\\'s primarily a batsman):\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(batruns) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(ballfaced) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Times MS Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' AND bat_out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Total Number of Matches Played by MS Dhoni (Batting):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs Scored by MS Dhoni (Batting):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(batruns) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN bat_out = FALSE THEN p_match ELSE NULL END) AS batting_average\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Highest Score by MS Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT MAX(batruns) AS highest_score\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\';\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7.  Number of Wickets Taken by MS Dhoni (Bowling):**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN out = TRUE AND p_bowl = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' LIMIT 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_wickets\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bowl = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'MS Dhoni\\' LIMIT 1)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.
