      "              AIMessage(content='Search Agent Response: \\nThe term \"cover drive\" is a standard cricket shot, and it directly matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\" in the database.\\n\\nThe term \"1-10\" refers to the overs range, which typically corresponds to the early phase of an innings in cricket. During this phase, the fielding restrictions are in place, and the batting team aims to score quickly. In cricket analytics, this phase is often referred to as the \"Powerplay\" or the \"Mandatory Powerplay.\"\\n\\nHowever, the database values returned for \"1-10\" do not directly relate to the overs range but rather to fielding positions or shot types. This discrepancy suggests that the database might not have a direct column for overs range, or the search did not correctly interpret the query.\\n\\nIn cricket, the terms related to overs range typically include:\\n\\nPowerplay\\nMandatory Powerplay\\nFirst 10 overs\\nTop order batting\\n\\nGiven the returned values, none directly match the typical terms used for the overs range in cricket. Therefore, it is essential to consider how the database might represent this phase of the game. If the database uses specific terms for the early phase of an innings, those terms should be identified and used for accurate queries.\\n\\nBased on the returned values and cricket knowledge, the most appropriate matches for the user\\'s query are:\\n\\n\"cover drive\" matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\"\\n\"1-10\" does not have a direct match in the returned values, indicating a potential need to rephrase the query or check the database schema for the correct representation of the overs range.\\n\\n{\\n    \"cover drive\": [\"COVER_DRIVE\",\"shot\"],\\n    \"1-10\": [ ]\\n\\n}', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='fe7d49cb-a282-4cd9-9c35-86fd0dbba0e6'),\n",

During this phase, the fielding restrictions are in place, and the batting team aims to score quickly. In cricket analytics, this phase is often referred to as the \"Powerplay\" or the \"Mandatory Powerplay.\"\\n\\nHowever, the database values returned for \"1-10\" do not directly relate to the overs range but rather to fielding positions or shot types. This discrepancy suggests that the database might not have a direct column for overs range, or the search did not correctly interpret the query.\\n\\nIn cricket, the terms related to overs range typically include:\\n\\nPowerplay\\nMandatory Powerplay\\nFirst 10 overs\\nTop order batting\\n\\nGiven the returned values, none directly match the typical terms used for the overs range in cricket. Therefore, it is essential to consider how the database might represent this phase of the game. If the database uses specific terms for the early phase of an innings, those terms should be identified and used for accurate queries.\\n\\nBased on the returned values and cricket knowledge, the most appropriate matches for the user\\'s query are:\\n\\n\"cover drive\" matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\"\\n\"1-10\" does not have a direct match in the returned values, indicating a potential need to rephrase the query or check the database schema for the correct representation of the overs range.\\n\\n{\\n    \"cover drive\": [\"COVER_DRIVE\",\"shot\"],\\n    \"1-10\": [ ]\\n\\n}', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='fe7d49cb-a282-4cd9-9c35-86fd0dbba0e6'),\n",

During this phase, the fielding restrictions are in place, and the batting team aims to score quickly. In cricket analytics, this phase is often referred to as the \"Powerplay\" or the \"Mandatory Powerplay.\"\\n\\nHowever, the database values returned for \"1-10\" do not directly relate to the overs range but rather to fielding positions or shot types. This discrepancy suggests that the database might not have a direct column for overs range, or the search did not correctly interpret the query.\\n\\nIn cricket, the terms related to overs range typically include:\\n\\nPowerplay\\nMandatory Powerplay\\nFirst 10 overs\\nTop order batting\\n\\nGiven the returned values, none directly match the typical terms used for the overs range in cricket. Therefore, it is essential to consider how the database might represent this phase of the game. If the database uses specific terms for the early phase of an innings, those terms should be identified and used for accurate queries.\\n\\nBased on the returned values and cricket knowledge, the most appropriate matches for the user\\'s query are:\\n\\n\"cover drive\" matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\"\\n\"1-10\" does not have a direct match in the returned values, indicating a potential need to rephrase the query or check the database schema for the correct representation of the overs range.\\n\\n{\\n    \"cover drive\": [\"COVER_DRIVE\",\"shot\"],\\n    \"1-10\": [ ]\\n\\n}', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='fe7d49cb-a282-4cd9-9c35-86fd0dbba0e6'),\n",

During this phase, the fielding restrictions are in place, and the batting team aims to score quickly. In cricket analytics, this phase is often referred to as the \"Powerplay\" or the \"Mandatory Powerplay.\"\\n\\nHowever, the database values returned for \"1-10\" do not directly relate to the overs range but rather to fielding positions or shot types. This discrepancy suggests that the database might not have a direct column for overs range, or the search did not correctly interpret the query.\\n\\nIn cricket, the terms related to overs range typically include:\\n\\nPowerplay\\nMandatory Powerplay\\nFirst 10 overs\\nTop order batting\\n\\nGiven the returned values, none directly match the typical terms used for the overs range in cricket. Therefore, it is essential to consider how the database might represent this phase of the game. If the database uses specific terms for the early phase of an innings, those terms should be identified and used for accurate queries.\\n\\nBased on the returned values and cricket knowledge, the most appropriate matches for the user\\'s query are:\\n\\n\"cover drive\" matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\"\\n\"1-10\" does not have a direct match in the returned values, indicating a potential need to rephrase the query or check the database schema for the correct representation of the overs range.\\n\\n{\\n    \"cover drive\": [\"COVER_DRIVE\",\"shot\"],\\n    \"1-10\": [ ]\\n\\n}', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='fe7d49cb-a282-4cd9-9c35-86fd0dbba0e6'),\n",

Here\\'s how we can approach it, keeping in mind the database schema and the context:\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query Strategy**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Filter for Steven Smith as the batter:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bat` column to identify Steve Smith\\'s player ID. Since we don\\'t know that ID directly, we\\'ll need a subquery to find it.\\\\n2.  **Filter for Leg Spin bowlers:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `bowl_style` column to select records where the bowler\\'s style is \\'LB\\'.\\\\n3.  **Join the tables**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bowl` column to join the `player` table with the `hdata` table to filter the bowlers with the given `bowl_style`\\\\n4.  **Aggregate the data**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll need to aggregate the data to get the desired bowler statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`SELECT b.bowl, ...`**: This selects the bowler\\'s name and calculates the required statistics\\\\n*   **`FROM hdata h`**: This specifies the `hdata` table with alias `h`\\\\n*   **`JOIN player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `b`) using the bowler\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`JOIN player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `bat`) using the batter\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`WHERE bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'`**: This filters the records to include only those where the batter is Steven Smith and the bowler\\'s style is Leg Break.\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY b.bowl`**: This groups the results by the bowler\\'s name, so we get aggregate statistics for each leg-spinner.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY balls_bowled DESC`**: This orders the results by the number of balls bowled in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Execute the query**: This SQL query should be executed against the database.\\\\n2.  **Analyze the results**: The results will show the performance of leg spinners against Steven Smith. The columns will include balls bowled, wickets taken, runs conceded, no balls, wides, and the number of times Steven Smith got out against that bowler.\\\\n\\\\nThis should provide a comprehensive view of leg spinners\\' performance against Steven Smith.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'e3ed92d0-5b71-4bb7-8c18-57ecdc697dec\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'60d16894-76f9-4f42-8747-41feccec7bab\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'eb041909-50fe-4736-972b-59617eb30e6f\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

Now that we have the mappings, we need to formulate an SQL query to retrieve the bowling records of leg spinners against Steven Smith. Here\\'s how we can approach it, keeping in mind the database schema and the context:\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query Strategy**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Filter for Steven Smith as the batter:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bat` column to identify Steve Smith\\'s player ID. Since we don\\'t know that ID directly, we\\'ll need a subquery to find it.\\\\n2.  **Filter for Leg Spin bowlers:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `bowl_style` column to select records where the bowler\\'s style is \\'LB\\'.\\\\n3.  **Join the tables**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bowl` column to join the `player` table with the `hdata` table to filter the bowlers with the given `bowl_style`\\\\n4.  **Aggregate the data**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll need to aggregate the data to get the desired bowler statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`SELECT b.bowl, ...`**: This selects the bowler\\'s name and calculates the required statistics\\\\n*   **`FROM hdata h`**: This specifies the `hdata` table with alias `h`\\\\n*   **`JOIN player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `b`) using the bowler\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`JOIN player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `bat`) using the batter\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`WHERE bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'`**: This filters the records to include only those where the batter is Steven Smith and the bowler\\'s style is Leg Break.\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY b.bowl`**: This groups the results by the bowler\\'s name, so we get aggregate statistics for each leg-spinner.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY balls_bowled DESC`**: This orders the results by the number of balls bowled in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Execute the query**: This SQL query should be executed against the database.\\\\n2.  **Analyze the results**: The results will show the performance of leg spinners against Steven Smith.

Now that we have the mappings, we need to formulate an SQL query to retrieve the bowling records of leg spinners against Steven Smith. Here\\'s how we can approach it, keeping in mind the database schema and the context:\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query Strategy**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Filter for Steven Smith as the batter:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bat` column to identify Steve Smith\\'s player ID. Since we don\\'t know that ID directly, we\\'ll need a subquery to find it.\\\\n2.  **Filter for Leg Spin bowlers:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `bowl_style` column to select records where the bowler\\'s style is \\'LB\\'.\\\\n3.  **Join the tables**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bowl` column to join the `player` table with the `hdata` table to filter the bowlers with the given `bowl_style`\\\\n4.  **Aggregate the data**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll need to aggregate the data to get the desired bowler statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`SELECT b.bowl, ...`**: This selects the bowler\\'s name and calculates the required statistics\\\\n*   **`FROM hdata h`**: This specifies the `hdata` table with alias `h`\\\\n*   **`JOIN player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `b`) using the bowler\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`JOIN player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `bat`) using the batter\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`WHERE bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'`**: This filters the records to include only those where the batter is Steven Smith and the bowler\\'s style is Leg Break.\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY b.bowl`**: This groups the results by the bowler\\'s name, so we get aggregate statistics for each leg-spinner.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY balls_bowled DESC`**: This orders the results by the number of balls bowled in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Execute the query**: This SQL query should be executed against the database.\\\\n2.  **Analyze the results**: The results will show the performance of leg spinners against Steven Smith. The columns will include balls bowled, wickets taken, runs conceded, no balls, wides, and the number of times Steven Smith got out against that bowler.\\\\n\\\\nThis should provide a comprehensive view of leg spinners\\' performance against Steven Smith.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'e3ed92d0-5b71-4bb7-8c18-57ecdc697dec\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'60d16894-76f9-4f42-8747-41feccec7bab\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'eb041909-50fe-4736-972b-59617eb30e6f\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='4120eb0f-2762-43de-accb-f17736f99e64')],\n",

Now that we have the mappings, we need to formulate an SQL query to retrieve the bowling records of leg spinners against Steven Smith.

Since we don\\'t know that ID directly, we\\'ll need a subquery to find it.\\\\n2.  **Filter for Leg Spin bowlers:**\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `bowl_style` column to select records where the bowler\\'s style is \\'LB\\'.\\\\n3.  **Join the tables**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll use the `p_bowl` column to join the `player` table with the `hdata` table to filter the bowlers with the given `bowl_style`\\\\n4.  **Aggregate the data**:\\\\n    *   We\\'ll need to aggregate the data to get the desired bowler statistics.\\\\n\\\\n**SQL Query**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    b.bowl,\\\\n    COUNT(*) AS balls_bowled,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN h.outcome = \\'wicket\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wickets,\\\\n    SUM(h.score) AS runs_conceded,\\\\n    SUM(h.noball) AS noballs,\\\\n    SUM(h.wide) AS wides,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN h.out = TRUE THEN 1 END) AS times_out\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata h\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id\\\\nJOIN\\\\n    player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'\\\\nGROUP BY\\\\n    b.bowl\\\\nORDER BY\\\\n    balls_bowled DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`SELECT b.bowl, ...`**: This selects the bowler\\'s name and calculates the required statistics\\\\n*   **`FROM hdata h`**: This specifies the `hdata` table with alias `h`\\\\n*   **`JOIN player b ON h.p_bowl = b.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `b`) using the bowler\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`JOIN player bat ON h.p_bat = bat.p_id`**: This joins `hdata` with the `player` table (aliased as `bat`) using the batter\\'s player ID.\\\\n*   **`WHERE bat.player = \\'Steven Smith\\' AND b.bowl_style = \\'LB\\'`**: This filters the records to include only those where the batter is Steven Smith and the bowler\\'s style is Leg Break.\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY b.bowl`**: This groups the results by the bowler\\'s name, so we get aggregate statistics for each leg-spinner.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY balls_bowled DESC`**: This orders the results by the number of balls bowled in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Execute the query**: This SQL query should be executed against the database.\\\\n2.  **Analyze the results**: The results will show the performance of leg spinners against Steven Smith.

It uses a subquery to get the `p_bat` id for David Warner and then sums the `score` column for all balls where he was the batter.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' LIMIT 1) THEN 1 END) AS balls_faced`**: Counts the number of balls faced by David Warner against India, using the same subquery approach.\\\\n*    **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dismissals`**: Calculates the number of times David Warner has been dismissed while batting against Indian bowlers.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.p_match) as matches_played`**: Counts the number of unique matches where David Warner has faced Indian bowlers.\\\\n*    **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.outcome = \\\\\\'4\\\\\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fours`**: Calculates the number of fours scored by David Warner against India.\\\\n*    **`SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.outcome = \\\\\\'6\\\\\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sixes`**: Calculates the number of sixes scored by David Warner against India.\\\\n*   **`WHERE hdata.team_bowl = \\\\\\'India\\\\\\' AND hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\\\\\'David Warner\\\\\\' LIMIT 1)`**: This filters the data to only include records where the bowling team is India and the batter is David Warner.\\\\n\\\\nThis query should provide a comprehensive overview of David Warner\\\\\\'s performance against Indian bowlers, including total runs, balls faced, dismissals, matches played, fours, and sixes.\\\\n\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'14c729eb-c16d-4767-8062-e55c61365956\\'), AIMessage(content=\"Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1) THEN hdata.score ELSE 0 END) AS total_runs,\\\\n    COUNT(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1) THEN 1 END) AS balls_faced,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS dismissals,\\\\n    COUNT(DISTINCT hdata.p_match) as matches_played,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.outcome = \\'4\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS fours,\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1) AND hdata.outcome = \\'6\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS sixes\\\\nFROM\\\\n    hdata\\\\nWHERE\\\\n    hdata.team_bowl = \\'India\\' AND hdata.p_bat = (SELECT p_bat FROM hdata WHERE bat = \\'David Warner\\' LIMIT 1);\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'59ea22c2-d852-4e2c-a425-1d4f802d6980\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'a7e94a60-b2b6-4ad0-b2ba-052a73261b27\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='504b49e6-19e6-489d-bb87-53b316b6dc5d'),\n",

versa.\\\\n2.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN h.bat = \\'Virat Kohli\\' AND h.bowl = \\'James Anderson\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS balls_faced_by_kohli`**: This counts the number of balls faced by Virat Kohli when James Anderson is bowling.\\\\n3.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN h.bat = \\'Virat Kohli\\' AND h.bowl = \\'James Anderson\\' THEN h.score ELSE 0 END) AS runs_scored_by_kohli`**: This calculates the total runs scored by Virat Kohli against James Anderson.\\\\n4.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN h.bat = \\'Virat Kohli\\' AND h.bowl = \\'James Anderson\\' AND h.out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS times_out_to_anderson`**: This counts how many times Virat Kohli got out to James Anderson.\\\\n5.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN h.bat = \\'James Anderson\\' AND h.bowl = \\'Virat Kohli\\' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS balls_faced_by_anderson`**: This

runs_scored_by_anderson`**: This calculates the total runs scored by James Anderson against Virat Kohli.\\\\n7.  **`SUM(CASE WHEN h.bat = \\'James Anderson\\' AND h.bowl = \\'Virat Kohli\\' AND h.out = TRUE THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS times_out_to_kohli`**: This counts how many times James Anderson got out to Virat Kohli.\\\\n8.  **`FROM hdata h`**: This specifies that we are querying from the `hdata` table aliased as `h`.\\\\n9.  **`WHERE (h.bat = \\'Virat Kohli\\' AND h.bowl = \\'James Anderson\\') OR (h.bat = \\'James Anderson\\' AND h.bowl = \\'Virat Kohli\\')`**: This filters the rows to only include the balls where Kohli was batting and Anderson was bowling, or vice-versa.\\\\n\\\\nThis query will give you the following head-to-head stats:\\\\n\\\\n*   Total matches where they have played against each other.\\\\n*   Total balls faced by Kohli against Anderson.\\\\n*   Total runs scored by Kohli against Anderson.\\\\n*   Number of times Kohli got out to Anderson.\\\\n*   Total balls

Dhoni\\'s career performance using the provided `hdata` table schema. Since we don\\'t have a specific player name column, I will use `p_bat` to represent the player id. You\\'ll need to know Dhoni\\'s player ID to use these queries effectively. Let\\'s assume his player ID is 123 (replace this with the actual ID).\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Matches Played by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Number of Times M.S. Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs per Innings for M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN p_match || \\'_\\' || inns ELSE NULL END) AS avg_runs\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Number of Fours Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_fours\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 4;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7. Number of Sixes Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_sixes\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 6;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.  Strike Rate of M.S. Dhoni (assuming strike rate is calculated on balls faced)**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 /\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS strike_rate\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**9. Dismissal Types for M.S. Dhoni**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`p_bat = 123`**: This condition filters the data for the player with player ID 123 (M.S. Dhoni).\\\\n*   **`SUM(score)`**: Calculates the sum of runs scored.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT p_match)`**: Counts the number of unique matches.\\\\n*   **`out = TRUE`**: Filters for instances where the player got out.\\\\n*   **`CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END`**: Ensures only runs scored by M.S. Dhoni are included in the sum.\\\\n*   **`p_match || \\'_\\' || inns`**: creates a unique identifier for each innings\\\\n*   **`CAST(... AS REAL)`**: Ensures that we get a decimal value when dividing for average and strike rate\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY dismissal`**: Groups the results by dismissal type.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY dismissal_count DESC`**: Orders the dismissal types by frequency in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Replace `123` with the actual player ID of M.S. Dhoni.\\\\n*   These queries assume that `p_bat` and `p_out` correctly identify the player during batting and when getting out respectively.\\\\n*   Some queries might need to be adjusted based on how your data is structured. For example, if you have a separate table with player names and IDs, you would need to include a `JOIN` operation.\\\\n*   The strike rate calculation assumes that strike rate is calculated based on balls faced not on balls bowled.\\\\n\\\\nThese queries provide a good starting point for analyzing M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance. Let me know if you have any specific analysis you\\'d like to perform, and I can adjust the queries accordingly.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c6df4278-66a8-499a-b6a1-843e5f027164\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'d7635a57-6330-4354-af24-3d74b3f9afdc\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c28c4bc1-d884-4e95-8747-a95deceb46f5\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})\n",

      "              HumanMessage(content='SQL Agent Response: [AIMessage(content=\"SQL Agent Response : Okay, I will now generate SQL queries to analyze M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance using the provided `hdata` table schema. Since we don\\'t have a specific player name column, I will use `p_bat` to represent the player id. You\\'ll need to know Dhoni\\'s player ID to use these queries effectively. Let\\'s assume his player ID is 123 (replace this with the actual ID).\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Matches Played by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Number of Times M.S. Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs per Innings for M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN p_match || \\'_\\' || inns ELSE NULL END) AS avg_runs\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Number of Fours Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_fours\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 4;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7. Number of Sixes Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_sixes\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 6;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.  Strike Rate of M.S. Dhoni (assuming strike rate is calculated on balls faced)**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 /\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS strike_rate\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**9. Dismissal Types for M.S. Dhoni**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`p_bat = 123`**: This condition filters the data for the player with player ID 123 (M.S. Dhoni).\\\\n*   **`SUM(score)`**: Calculates the sum of runs scored.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT p_match)`**: Counts the number of unique matches.\\\\n*   **`out = TRUE`**: Filters for instances where the player got out.\\\\n*   **`CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END`**: Ensures only runs scored by M.S. Dhoni are included in the sum.\\\\n*   **`p_match || \\'_\\' || inns`**: creates a unique identifier for each innings\\\\n*   **`CAST(... AS REAL)`**: Ensures that we get a decimal value when dividing for average and strike rate\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY dismissal`**: Groups the results by dismissal type.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY dismissal_count DESC`**: Orders the dismissal types by frequency in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Replace `123` with the actual player ID of M.S. Dhoni.\\\\n*   These queries assume that `p_bat` and `p_out` correctly identify the player during batting and when getting out respectively.\\\\n*   Some queries might need to be adjusted based on how your data is structured. For example, if you have a separate table with player names and IDs, you would need to include a `JOIN` operation.\\\\n*   The strike rate calculation assumes that strike rate is calculated based on balls faced not on balls bowled.\\\\n\\\\nThese queries provide a good starting point for analyzing M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance. Let me know if you have any specific analysis you\\'d like to perform, and I can adjust the queries accordingly.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c6df4278-66a8-499a-b6a1-843e5f027164\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'d7635a57-6330-4354-af24-3d74b3f9afdc\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c28c4bc1-d884-4e95-8747-a95deceb46f5\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='b05f8cbd-c780-4e02-b011-44c7027765b2')],\n",

      "              HumanMessage(content='SQL Agent Response: [AIMessage(content=\"SQL Agent Response : Okay, I will now generate SQL queries to analyze M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance using the provided `hdata` table schema. Since we don\\'t have a specific player name column, I will use `p_bat` to represent the player id. You\\'ll need to know Dhoni\\'s player ID to use these queries effectively. Let\\'s assume his player ID is 123 (replace this with the actual ID).\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Matches Played by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Number of Times M.S. Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs per Innings for M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN p_match || \\'_\\' || inns ELSE NULL END) AS avg_runs\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Number of Fours Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_fours\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 4;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7. Number of Sixes Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_sixes\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 6;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.  Strike Rate of M.S. Dhoni (assuming strike rate is calculated on balls faced)**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 /\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS strike_rate\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**9. Dismissal Types for M.S. Dhoni**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`p_bat = 123`**: This condition filters the data for the player with player ID 123 (M.S. Dhoni).\\\\n*   **`SUM(score)`**: Calculates the sum of runs scored.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT p_match)`**: Counts the number of unique matches.\\\\n*   **`out = TRUE`**: Filters for instances where the player got out.\\\\n*   **`CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END`**: Ensures only runs scored by M.S. Dhoni are included in the sum.\\\\n*   **`p_match || \\'_\\' || inns`**: creates a unique identifier for each innings\\\\n*   **`CAST(... AS REAL)`**: Ensures that we get a decimal value when dividing for average and strike rate\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY dismissal`**: Groups the results by dismissal type.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY dismissal_count DESC`**: Orders the dismissal types by frequency in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Replace `123` with the actual player ID of M.S. Dhoni.\\\\n*   These queries assume that `p_bat` and `p_out` correctly identify the player during batting and when getting out respectively.\\\\n*   Some queries might need to be adjusted based on how your data is structured. For example, if you have a separate table with player names and IDs, you would need to include a `JOIN` operation.\\\\n*   The strike rate calculation assumes that strike rate is calculated based on balls faced not on balls bowled.\\\\n\\\\nThese queries provide a good starting point for analyzing M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance. Let me know if you have any specific analysis you\\'d like to perform, and I can adjust the queries accordingly.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c6df4278-66a8-499a-b6a1-843e5f027164\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'d7635a57-6330-4354-af24-3d74b3f9afdc\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c28c4bc1-d884-4e95-8747-a95deceb46f5\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='b05f8cbd-c780-4e02-b011-44c7027765b2')],\n",

      "              HumanMessage(content='SQL Agent Response: [AIMessage(content=\"SQL Agent Response : Okay, I will now generate SQL queries to analyze M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance using the provided `hdata` table schema. Since we don\\'t have a specific player name column, I will use `p_bat` to represent the player id. You\\'ll need to know Dhoni\\'s player ID to use these queries effectively. Let\\'s assume his player ID is 123 (replace this with the actual ID).\\\\n\\\\nHere are some example queries:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Total Runs Scored by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(score) AS total_runs\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**2. Total Balls Faced by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_balls_faced\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**3. Number of Matches Played by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT p_match) AS matches_played\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**4. Number of Times M.S. Dhoni Got Out:**\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS times_out\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND out = TRUE;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**5. Average Runs per Innings for M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT \\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN p_match || \\'_\\' || inns ELSE NULL END) AS avg_runs\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**6. Number of Fours Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_fours\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 4;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**7. Number of Sixes Hit by M.S. Dhoni:**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS num_sixes\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_bat = 123 AND score = 6;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**8.  Strike Rate of M.S. Dhoni (assuming strike rate is calculated on balls faced)**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT\\\\n    CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END) AS REAL) * 100 /\\\\n    SUM(CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS strike_rate\\\\nFROM hdata;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**9. Dismissal Types for M.S. Dhoni**\\\\n\\\\n```sql\\\\nSELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n**Explanation:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **`p_bat = 123`**: This condition filters the data for the player with player ID 123 (M.S. Dhoni).\\\\n*   **`SUM(score)`**: Calculates the sum of runs scored.\\\\n*   **`COUNT(DISTINCT p_match)`**: Counts the number of unique matches.\\\\n*   **`out = TRUE`**: Filters for instances where the player got out.\\\\n*   **`CASE WHEN p_bat = 123 THEN score ELSE 0 END`**: Ensures only runs scored by M.S. Dhoni are included in the sum.\\\\n*   **`p_match || \\'_\\' || inns`**: creates a unique identifier for each innings\\\\n*   **`CAST(... AS REAL)`**: Ensures that we get a decimal value when dividing for average and strike rate\\\\n*   **`GROUP BY dismissal`**: Groups the results by dismissal type.\\\\n*   **`ORDER BY dismissal_count DESC`**: Orders the dismissal types by frequency in descending order.\\\\n\\\\n**Important:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Replace `123` with the actual player ID of M.S. Dhoni.\\\\n*   These queries assume that `p_bat` and `p_out` correctly identify the player during batting and when getting out respectively.\\\\n*   Some queries might need to be adjusted based on how your data is structured. For example, if you have a separate table with player names and IDs, you would need to include a `JOIN` operation.\\\\n*   The strike rate calculation assumes that strike rate is calculated based on balls faced not on balls bowled.\\\\n\\\\nThese queries provide a good starting point for analyzing M.S. Dhoni\\'s career performance. Let me know if you have any specific analysis you\\'d like to perform, and I can adjust the queries accordingly.\\\\n\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c6df4278-66a8-499a-b6a1-843e5f027164\\'), AIMessage(content=\\'Final SQL query for user query  : SELECT dismissal, COUNT(*) AS dismissal_count\\\\nFROM hdata\\\\nWHERE p_out = 123\\\\nGROUP BY dismissal\\\\nORDER BY dismissal_count DESC;\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'d7635a57-6330-4354-af24-3d74b3f9afdc\\'), HumanMessage(content=\\'next what should it be done?\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id=\\'c28c4bc1-d884-4e95-8747-a95deceb46f5\\')]', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='b05f8cbd-c780-4e02-b011-44c7027765b2'),\n",
