    "search_result": "The term \"cover drive\" is a standard cricket shot, and it directly matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\" in the database.\n\nThe term \"1-10\" refers to the overs range, which typically corresponds to the early phase of an innings in cricket. During this phase, the fielding restrictions are in place, and the batting team aims to score quickly. In cricket analytics, this phase is often referred to as the \"Powerplay\" or the \"Mandatory Powerplay.\"\n\nHowever, the database values returned for \"1-10\" do not directly relate to the overs range but rather to fielding positions or shot types. This discrepancy suggests that the database might not have a direct column for overs range, or the search did not correctly interpret the query.\n\nIn cricket, the terms related to overs range typically include:\n\nPowerplay\nMandatory Powerplay\nFirst 10 overs\nTop order batting\n\nGiven the returned values, none directly match the typical terms used for the overs range in cricket. Therefore, it is essential to consider how the database might represent this phase of the game. If the database uses specific terms for the early phase of an innings, those terms should be identified and used for accurate queries.\n\nBased on the returned values and cricket knowledge, the most appropriate matches for the user's query are:\n\n\"cover drive\" matches with \"COVER_DRIVE\"\n\"1-10\" does not have a direct match in the returned values, indicating a potential need to rephrase the query or check the database schema for the correct representation of the overs range.\n\n{\n    \"cover drive\": [\"COVER_DRIVE\",\"shot\"],\n    \"1-10\": [ ]\n\n}"
